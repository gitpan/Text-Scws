Description
-----------

This module provides a Perl interface to the libscsw library, 
For more details see the POD documentation embedded in the file Scsw.pm,
which will also be installed as Text::Scws(3) man page.

Prerequisites
-------------

libscws

Building the module
-------------------

The module can be built using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

If your scws library is in a non-standard path, you might have to help it.  
You can specify library and include paths like this:

    perl Makefile.PL LIBS='-L/path/to/lib' INC='-I/path/to/include

You might also have to do this if you have multiple libscws
implementations installed and want to use a specific one.

The purpose of the test scripts (run by "make test") is to check if an
scws library can be found, and if the scws functions can be called.

Installation
------------

    make install
